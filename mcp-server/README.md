## Features

### üîç Process Management
- List all running processes
- Find processes by name or pattern
- Attach to processes for memory access
- Get detailed process information

### üß† Memory Operations
- Read/write memory with multiple data types (int32, int64, float, double, string, bytes)
- Advanced memory scanning (patterns, strings, values)
- Memory region analysis
- Pointer chain following
- Find pointers to specific addresses

### üñ±Ô∏è System Automation
- **Mouse Control**: Move, click, get position
- **Keyboard Control**: Send keys, text input
- **Screen Analysis**: Screenshots, pixel colors, color finding
- **Window Management**: List, find, control windows
- **System Information**: Get screen resolution, OS info

### ‚ö° Advanced Capabilities
